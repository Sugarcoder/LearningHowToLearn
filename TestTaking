TEST CHECKLIST
- Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
- Did you work with others to solve the problem? 
- Did you participate actively in homework group discussions? 
- Did you consult with the instructor if you have an issue with something? 
- Did you ask questions that weren't clear to you?


TEST-TAKING (Hard start, jump to easy)
- Glance at the overall task first. Start on the harder problems first, because then everything else becomes easier. 
- If the problem is too hard after a couple minutes, pull yourself away and try to solve something else. 

Test-taking strategies: 
- "This test got be excited to do my best!" 

- Turn attention to breathing, and draw a deep breath. Deep breathing counteracts the 'flight or flight' anxiety. 
- Face your fears! Have a Plan B for the alternative career. 
- Study hard up until the day of the test, and then let it go. That will release stress, and help you get closer to Plan A. 

- Good worry = provides motivation and focus
- Bad worry = wastes energy

- Step back, take a look at the problem and ask yourself, "Does this really make sense?"

- You have not truly learned something unless you can teach it to others. 
Teach those ideas to others, and you will realize that they will continue to deepen in your own mind.

- Passions can broaden, change and grow. 
- "The virtue of the less brilliant" = perseverance through hardship
