--------Illusion of Competence--------

- Glancing at a solution and assuming you understand the concept. 
- Students rely on the book and imagine the info is in their brain, but itâ€™s not. 
- You must have the info in your memory to master a subject. 
- Highlight minimally, and only highlight key concepts. 
- Mini-tests will help you retain information and grasp an idea. 

- It is good to make mistakes so you understand what the flaws are. 
Mistakes help correct your thinking so you can learn and do better. 
- Learning in other environments help you become independent of where you know the materials. 
It makes you less stressed in remembering materials in a different environment (home, classroom, cafe, library).

- Deliberate practice = Focus intently on the parts of the problem that are more difficult to you. 

- Einstellung = Instillating a road block when you are learning something. 

- Don't jump into the water without knowing how to swim. Understanding how to obtain real solution is more important in mastering a subject. 

- The best way is 'Interleaving'. Interleaving = solve problems with different types of procedures/approaches. 

- Deliberate practice = Find out how to solve with one technique versus another technique. 

- Interleaving is very important in learning, because it helps with creativity and flexibility in thinking.
