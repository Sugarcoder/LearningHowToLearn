PART I: 

Pomodoro timer method for procrastination
- Set a timer to 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions and then focus. Reward yourself afterwards so your brain enjoys it. It is very effective. 

- The more abstract something is, the more practice it will take in order to bring those ideas into reality for you. Need to build and strengthen whatever you are trying to learn. 

- Practice makes permanent. 

- Focus on something intently, then take a break. 

- Spaced Repetition = space it out over a number of days for something you want to remember and put it in the long term memory. 

- Too little sleep over a long period of time is associated with all sorts of issues: depression, headaches, diabetes, dying earlier.

PART II: 

- Reframe things - focus on Process, not on Product. 

- Process = the flow of time and the habits of actions associated with the time (ex. I will focus on learning for 20 minutes).
- Product = the outcome

- Processes relate to the simple habits. 
- Avoid focusing on the Product (Product triggers the pain that cause you to procrastinate).
- Calmly put forth your best effort during the process of doing something. 
- The more you do something, the easier it becomes.
